# Deep-RL-Navigation

This project featured an agent learning to navigate and collect bananas in a Unity simulated environment. The agent was trained in a reinforcement learning framework, where the agent had actions to move forward, backward, left or right, and received +1 reward for collecting yellow bananas and -1 reward for collecting blue bananas.
