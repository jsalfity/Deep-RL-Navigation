# Deep-RL-Navigation

This project featured an agent learning to navigate and collect bananas in a Unity simulated environment. The agent was trained in a reinforcement learning framework, where the agent had actions to move forward, backward, left or right, and received +1 reward for collecting yellow bananas and -1 reward for collecting blue bananas.

The environment is considered solved when the agent has learned a policy that receives an average reward of 13 over 100 episodes.

To run the code, navigate to `Navigation.ipynb`.

See Report.pdf for more information on the environment, the learning algorithm, results, and ideas for future work.
